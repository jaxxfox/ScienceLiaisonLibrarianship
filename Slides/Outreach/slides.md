# Why outreach? And what is outreach?

Some trends in academic librarianship, include library budget cuts, reduced purchasing power, the availability of electronic resources, and the decreasing need to visit the library or consult a subject specialist, have increased the sense of urgency to foster new service roles based on an outreach-centered paradigm.

# Outreach

- advocacy and consultation services, such as promoting current and new and innovative library services to users
- providing information literacy instruction
- developing and maintaining collections, increasingly in partnership with faculty  
- offering subject-specific customized research services 
- providing course-integrated library instruction and participating in curriculum development  
- referring researchers to functional specialists (e.g., copy-right, open access, data management, digital humanities)
- representing user needs to library decision-makers 
- increasing collaboration and partnerships with faculty

# Engagement

- The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching defines community engagement as the "collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities (local, regional/state, national, global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity" (Carnegie, 2006).
- Engagement initiatives is often hampered because university research is designed narrowly, with community partners acting as passive participants, not partners in discovery.

---

# Boundary Spanning

- Boundary spanning can be defined as the "bridge between an organization and its exchange partners" (Scott, 1998, p. 196).
- At the individual level, spanners are actors who are primarily responsible for interacting with constituents outside their organization.
- At the organizational level, boundary-spanning roles may be more accurately not confined to an individual job description, but broader institutional strategies to engage with external partners.
- Past research suggests that spanners with the best ideas (high expertise) may not necessarily be the one most qualified to help the group become internally integrated (socio-emotional skills). 
- Social closeness in this study is understood as the degree to which the spanner is aligned with the external partner versus the organization that he or she represents (i.e., gatekeepers).

# Phase 1 Tactics for Introducing Yourself

- Introducing yourself and promoting library services and resources. It requires meeting users for relationship-building, creating trust, and establishing yourself as a “go-to” person— progressing gradually to more collaborative relationships.
- Be friendly and start “hallway conversations”: have ready a 3-minute elevator speech (who you are what you do, resources and services the library provides, special services you can provide).
- Network: to whom can your initial contacts introduce you (e.g., online instructors, researchers, faculty teaching high enrollment classes)?
- Make appointments with targeted individuals.

# Phase 1 Tactics for Instruction and availability

- Make class visits/presentations on library resources and research.
- Promote one-on-one reference and research assistance.
- Offer to provide class-specific orientations and tours in the library. 
- Timing is key; be sensitive to semester highs and lows.
- Expand your clock to work earlier or later depending on key college, department, or other academic unit activities (e.g., research showcase, student exhibits, and receptions).
- Join disciplinary electronic discussion lists.

---

# Phase 2 Tactics for Building Relationships

- Provide regular and periodic communication about new and ongoing services (e.g., open access, copyright, data management workshops, events). 
- Create and send out your own periodic library newsletter. 
- Intensify contacts with users; for example, invite key people, such as student leaders, graduate coordinators, and faculty to coffee breaks or lunch.
- Welcome new faculty and offer to provide a library orientation; consider following up the orientation “with a meeting over coffee to further the personal relationship.”
- Know what is happening with individual faculty and write congratulatory notes for research, publications, awards, grants, etc.

---

# Phase 2 Tactics for Instruction and Special Programs

- Provide topical workshops (e.g., RefWorks, EndNotes, plagiarism). 
- Increase library instruction to departments and classes: 
  * Search all course syllabi in order to evaluate and identify the need for specific guides to library resources within units, and to respond to course and discipline needs.
  * Create disciplinary, course-specific, and/or assignment LibGuides as needed.
  * Become embedded in courses by partnering with in-structors. 
- Create topical library exhibits.
- Support college/department special events (e.g., assistance, participation, exhibits).

---

# Phase 2 Tactics for Activities, Collection Development and Developing Subject Expertise

- Become aware of college/department activities (e.g., research priorities and needs, seminars, and special events) and participate for increased participation and customized services.
- Participate in departmental new-student orientations. 
- Develop and maintain comprehensive knowledge of the information resources pertinent to your liaison areas.
  * Select appropriate electronic resources to support the academic unit. 
  * Notify individual faculty about new materials of interest to their research or teaching.
- Develop and exhibit a passion for the subject and learn the language of the subject field.  
- Develop knowledge of the disciplinary/professional as-sociations (local, state, and national) and their activities, conferences, and committees. 
  * Join electronic discussion lists, association committees, attend conferences, etc..

# Phase 3 Tactics for Collaboration and Beyond

- Assessments are needed to determine faculty and student awareness of, and satisfaction with, and liaison services, especially in comparison to the liaison’s impressions and choices.
- Provide information literacy course-integrated instruction. 
- Co-teach with departmental faculty.  
- Teach a departmental credit course.
- Establish research partnership with academic faculty or join faculty research team to co-publish.
- Collaborate on external or internal (university or library) grant opportunities. 
- Support departmental accreditation efforts (see your institution’s accreditation website), and work with faculty to meet official departmental learning outcomes.
