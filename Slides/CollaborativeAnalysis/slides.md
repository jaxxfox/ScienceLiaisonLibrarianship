# Stop, Collaborate, and Listen

- Slack (nifty free version)
- Dropbox
- Microsoft Teams, 365
- Github
- Google Drive, Docs, Collab
- And many others

---

# Slack

- Instant messaging service
- “Freemium”- free version available, paid version with more features
- Used as community platform
- Channels

# Dropbox

- Share and save things to the cloud.
- Access from anywhere!
- Ingrates with other tools.
- Not infinite free space.

# Microsoft Teams

- Pros: Productivity, Easy Implementation with other Microsoft stuff, chat, channels, Feds use it
- Cons: Confusing file structures, lack of authority control, limited flexibility, Thanos uses it

# Github

- Online software development platform
- Used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects
- Can be used to host and share other files, like these course materials
- Easy method for sharing code files and collaborate on open source projects

# Galileo's Notebook 

![Pages of Galileo's Notebook](https://github.com/jaxxfox/ScienceLiaisonLibrarianship/blob/main/Slides/Images/gnotebook2.jpg?raw=true)

Galileo's notes directly integrated his **data** (drawings of Jupiter and its moons),

key **metadata** (timing of each observation, weather, and telescope properties), 

and **text** (descriptions of methods, analysis, and conclusions).

# Open Notebook Science
- Sharing scientific progress *while it is happening*
- openlabnotebooks.org – A growing team of groundbreaking scientists around the world are now sharing their lab notebooks online

# Jupyter Notebooks

Computers are good at consuming, producing and processing data. Humans, on the other hand, process the world through narratives. Thus, in order for data, and the computations that process and visualize that data, to be useful for humans, they must be embedded into a narrative - a computational narrative - that tells a story for a particular audience and context.

Perez, Fernando, and Brian E. Granger. *"Project Jupyter: Computational narratives as the engine of collaborative data science."*

# Google Colaboratory (Colab)

- Internal branch of Jupyter that Google released for public use
- A variant of Jupyter, but also:
  * Has collaboration. Work together like in Google Docs!
  * Runs on the web < Easier to hop in and reproduce research
  * Included free computational resources from Google

# Pair programming

- Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

- While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.

# Participation Activity #5 – Part 1

- Form teams of three and Colab in Colab by copying this notebook and sharing it with each other (1 “expert” per group pls)
- https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization.ipynb
- Upload a new image and convert (save to include in your Team report)

# Participation Activity #5 - Part 2

- Pick one of the Ten Favourite Colab Notebooks or others if you know of others and work through another exercise
- Save a copy in DRIVE
- https://github.com/firmai/awesome-google-colab
- Upload a brief team reflection into Canvas discussion board
