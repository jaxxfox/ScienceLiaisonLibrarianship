# Microsoft Teams

- Pros: Productivity, Easy Implementation with other Microsoft stuff, chat, channels
- Cons: Confusing file structures, lack of authority control, limited flexibility

# Github

- Online software development platform
- Used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects
- Can be used to host and share other files, like these course materials
- Easy method for sharing code files and collaborate on open source projects

# Galileo's Notebook 

![Pages of Galileo's Notebook](https://github.com/jaxxfox/ScienceLiaisonLibrarianship/blob/main/Slides/Images/gnotebook2.jpg?raw=true)

Galileo's notes directly integrated his **data** (drawings of Jupiter and its moons),

key **metadata** (timing of each observation, weather, and telescope properties), 

and **text** (descriptions of methods, analysis, and conclusions).

# Jupyter Notebooks

Computers are good at consuming, producing and processing data. Humans, on the other hand, process the world through narratives. Thus, in order for data, and the computations that process and visualize that data, to be useful for humans, they must be embedded into a narrative - a computational narrative - that tells a story for a particular audience and context.

# Google Colaboratory (Colab)

- Internal branch of Jupyter that Google released for public use
- A variant of Jupyter, but also:
  * Has collaboration. Work together like in Google Docs!
  * Runs on the web < Easier to hop in and reproduce research
  * Included free computational resources from Google

# Pair programming

- Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

- While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.
