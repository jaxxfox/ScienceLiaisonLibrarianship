# Bibliometrics, Scientometrics, and Informetrics

- Bibliometrics is the study of the quantitative aspects of the production, dissemination, and use of recorded information. 
- Scientometrics is the study of the quantitative aspects of science as a discipline or economic activity.
- Informetrics is the study of the quantitative aspects of information in any form, not just records or bibliographies, and in any social group, not just scientists.

# Some examples of informetrics work

- statistical aspects of language, word, and phrase frequencies, in both natural language text and indexes, in both printed and electronic media; 
- characteristics of authors-productivity measured by number of papers or other means, degree of collaboration;
- citation analysis: distribution over authors, papers, institutions, journals, countries; use in evaluation; co-citation-based mapping of disciplines;
- use of recorded information: library circulation and in-house book and journal use, database use.

# N-gram

- an **n-gram** is a contiguous sequence of *n* items from a given *sample* of text or speech
- Use the previous N-1 words in a sequence to predict the next word
- Language Model (LM)
  * unigrams, bigrams, trigrams,…
- How do we train these models?
  * Very large corpora

# Eugene Garfield (1925-2017)

- Indexed journals
- Invented basic metrics
- Impact factor

---

# Proposed that who cites who and what is one way to analyze science

(Article?)

---

# First mention of Impact Factor

- Garfield suggests that each article is given a code and all works that cited that article would be linked to the original article.
- Garfield recommends keeping track of who cited the paper. 
  * “In effect, the system would provide a complete listing, for the publications covered, of all the original articles that had referred to the article in question.” …  Such an “**impact factor**” may be much more indicative than an absolute count of a scientist's publications.”
- Here impact factor refers to the impact of the **article**.
- In the early 1960’s Irving H. Sher and Eugene Garfield created the **Journal Impact Factor** to help select journals for *Science Citation Index (SCI)*.
- But these same ideas were quickly applied to journals and authors

---

# Journal Impact Factor Formula

( The number of times articles published in (2 years) were cited by indexed journals ) divided by ( Total number of citable items (2 years) )

---

# H Factor or H Index

- Index that attempts to measure both the productivity and impact of the published work of a **scientist or scholar**.
- A scholar with an index of *h* has published *h* papers each of which has been cited by others at least *h* times.
- Serves as an alternative to more traditional journal impact factor metrics in the evaluation of the impact of the work of a **particular researcher**

# Academic Genealogy matters

- Academic genealogy is valuable because it provides context, history and has the potential to predict **future trends** in a particular discipline or field.
- The MPACT Project (http://www.ibiblio.org/mpact/) is an academic genealogy project devoted to defining and assessing mentoring as a scholarly activity, examining the emergence and interaction of disciplines, and identifying patterns of knowledge diffusion.
