2. Develop and deliver a Science Liaison Librarianship course;
3. Design and facilitate Science Practica with mentors;
4. Participate in cohort-building activities that include original research on science liaison librarianship job analyses and scientists’ information needs; and
5. Disseminate findings via a summit and a plethora of new research on the collaborative tasks of scientists and librarians disseminated through relevant conferences, venues, and publications.

# CALL Goal and RQs

The goal of this three-year project is to expand knowledge of science liaison librarianship. 

The project will address broad research questions related to the practice and implementation of science liaison librarianship:
- What knowledge, skills, and abilities are required for science liaison librarianship?
- What tasks and topics should be included in curriculum to best prepare future science liaison librarians?
- What are common and frequent information needs of scientists served by liaisons?
- How can the capabilities and roles of science liaison librarians be conveyed to scientists?
