# Participation Activities (20%)
(five different activities due various dates throughout)

- It is important to note that class participation is twenty percent of your grade because participation is an important component of facilitating learning in this class.
- These activities supplement other assignments.
- There are 6 each worth 10 points.
- They will be described in class lectures and discussed in class meetings.

---

# Interview with a Librarian (20%)

1. Locate and contact a willing librarian/information professional. For example, someone with a job you would like to have or know more about. This is a hectic time, but I’ve found that most librarians are very willing to help students (and like talking about themselves). This should take 20 minutes of their time.
2. Collect the librarians academic and work history.
  * What is your current job title?
  * What is your current rank?
  * How many years in total have you been working in your current job?
  * How many years in total have you been working with research data (including relevant higher education and experience as a researcher)?
  * Please indicate your credentials and degrees.
  * Please provide any other education or training you have received that is applicable to performing your job.
3. Your paper is your own, so you may use other questions that interest you.
4. You should probably ask about typical liaison tasks from the readings, but all of this depends on the type of information professional you select.
5. Please provide a conclusion that highlights what surprised you and what you would like to learn most in the class to prepare you for a job.
6. To give full attention to the paper, please produce at least 1,000 words of content.

---

# Summary of a Community short paper and presentation (25%)

1. Introduce the community you chose. This might be a domain, discipline, organization, profession, or other group.
2. Provide an annotated list of the group’s prominent communication outlets (i.e., journals), organizations, associations, conferences, trainings, vendors, related industries.
3. Describe the common and frequent information needs of scientists in this community.
4. Design an evaluation for how you could study this community further.
5. Prepare a summary presentation to inform other liaisons (5 min).
6. To give full attention to this assignment, please produce at least 1,000 words of content.
7. If you have others interested in the same resource/topic, then form a group (no more than 3).

---

# Final Project and Presentation (35%):

This is an opportunity for you to select a topic that interests you!  A one-page proposal of your paper is due earlier in the semester. This proposal is worth 12 points. The proposal should be written in sentence form (not an outline) and should contain the following:
1. Select and describe a topic, with a working title, brief description of the topic you plan to research and also a literature review for consideration (at least 3 sources). Pick a topic that will benefit your future and that you will enjoy.
2. Find research articles (peer-reviewed) on the topic, and use your interpretation and evaluation of the research to inform important aspects of the liaison librarianship; DO NOT simply summarize what has been researched, but relate the research articles to each other and synthesize a theme out of the articles you find. Each topic will have a different number of key articles, but for a final paper this length I expect~15-20 citations.
3. Discuss future implications for the field related to your topic and specifically for your career.
4. Finally, you will prepare a 10 minute presentation of your paper to inform the class.
5. As a semester long assignment, I have high expectations for the quality of this work. You should produce a project that is of publishable quality. I am indifferent about structure or citation style; however, be consistent and do not hesitate to ask for clarification. In fact, this opportunity of the CALL research summit means all have a venue to share what you learn in an actual presentation, paper, or poster.

To give full attention to the paper, please produce at least 3,000 words of content.
Follow the rubric!

# What is Science Liaison Librarianship?

“We performed literature searches using the concepts “role*” and “information professional*” and “role*” and “archivist*” in the Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA) database. LISA contains the most documents related to library science specializations. Along with concepts related to types of centre (“school librarian”, “academic librarian”, “hospital librarian” and “public librarian”), several other roles appear in a large number of documents, including but not limited to “reference librarian” (n = 1659), “librarian as teacher” (n = 285), “subject librarian” (n = 277), “embedded/blended librarian” (n = 248), “liaison librarian” (n = 162) and “digital librarian” (n = 83). ”

# What is Science Liaison Librarianship?

- Two operative questions here
  * What is liaison librarianship?
  * What is science? (Next class meeting)
- The first is what we are dealing with now

# Things were complicated in 1934

- “in actual practice, the instructor and the librarian have few contacts and little cooperation”
- “How many librarians act on their own initiative to acquaint themselves with the library needs of various courses?”
- “they must acquire special knowledge of the literature an the course of instruction in particular fields”
- “Cooperation would be greatly facilitated by the designation of one librarian to act as liaison officer”
- “individual librarians might develop special knowledge of the literature and the courses of instruction in particular fields”

Hurt, P. (1934). "Bridging the Gulf between the College Classroom and the Library." *Library Journal, 59,* 748-51.

---

# Greatest needs in 1934 in an academic library

1. General instruction in library use
2. A recognized line of communication between the library and the classrooms
3. A thorough understanding by librarians of the library needs of each course of instruction

What’s different now?

# What does a liaison librarian do?

- “Historically, reference, liaison, and subject librarians performed the role of connecting people to the information they needed in a visible way, sitting behind a reference desk or, since the 1970s, in front of a classroom full of students for information literacy instruction. […] as users simply click through a Google search to get to the information they need, how do academic reference librarians continue to be visible and connected to the students and faculty they are supposed to be helping?” (Johnson, 2019)
- Reference (Desk, Phone, Email, Chat, and beyond)
- Instruction
- Collection Development
- Research Enterprise Facilitator?

Johnson, A. (2019). Connections, Conversations, and Visibility: How the Work of Academic Reference and Liaison Librarians Is Evolving. *Reference & User Services Quarterly, 58*(2), 91-102. doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.5860/rusq.58.2.6929

---

# NEEDED skills for liaison librarians

- Subject Expertise – any liaison must have an understanding of the topics and the needs of their users (can be learned)
- Communication, Teaching, and Outreach skills also key 
- Feedback with users, foster trust
- Know your community and their resources (e.g., Faculty pubs)

---

# Skills needed when hiring liaison librarians from current Administrators 

- Reference: 
  * “can they do the reference interview, can they provide excellent customer service if they are doing things online, good chat reference, how do they interact with people online…”
  * “good sense of how to search, and search technology….grounding in [subject] and…knowing the jargon, and …knowing what types of research is out there….”
- Instruction: 
  * Instruction skills, being comfortable in front of a class, and teaching effectively were noted by three administrator.
- Networking: 
  * “…excellent communicators.”
  * “…ability to build relationships.”
  * “…a great emphasis on comfort level with diversity.”
- Research: 
  * “…we must be plugged into the research enterprise….Where’s the money for grants coming from? We need to be supporting those people.”

 # Communication (i.e., soft skills)

- “soft skills” essential and mentioned many times
- How hard is it to say hello?
- How about Follow up?
- Profiling users/faculty – interests, current research projects, courses taught, rank
- Attending meetings, quarterly newsletter, informational flyers, one-minute video
- Social MEDIA!!!

---

# New and old services

- Database and software resources
- Interlibrary loan (ILL)
- Research, authorship, grant assistance
- Citation management
- Institutional repositories
- Accreditation
- What else?

# What is Embedded Librarianship (EL)?

- Recall that “embedded/blended librarian” (n = 248) had many more articles than “liaison librarian” (n = 162)
- Talwal (2014) explained that there is a great shift in the role of librarian of mere custodian of information sources and services to EL, who is redefining the role of librarians by reactively answering a research request, developing a unique understanding of users need and delivering proactive results.
- The phrase “embedded librarianship” takes root from “embedded journalists,” a concept tied to wartime media coverage. In this situation journalist becomes part of the military similarly librarians go do whatever is needed.
- Sound familiar?

---

# LIS Literature on Embedded Librarianship

- Information Literacy (10)
- Distance and Online Learning (33)
- Course, classrooms, and departments (8)
- Research (5)
  * Librarians are in the business of research support but, on most campuses, have little direct contact with research centers. 
  * A strategic effort to make consistent contact with specialized research centers ensures that researchers have the most thorough and current information resources to support their work.
- Does liaison sound better to you than embedded?

# Why all the job title changes?

- A search for where management interests and customer interests are aligned, and customer value leads to support that can translate directly into funding for whatever library services might be called.
- Libraries should be involved in the complete information chain and start archiving and publishing knowledge created in the universities and provide knowledge access to users.
- Libraries also provide the consultations regarding intellectual property rights, publications and the preservation of scholarly works.

---

# How do you find out what someone wants?

- Ask!
- “Usually, it’s being an expert in a subject area and working closely with faculty, staff, and students…, trying to figure out what they’re working on and how can the library…can best meet those needs.”
- If you aren’t already well versed in a community, then do a NEEDS ASSESSMENT!

# You have been assigned these for these reasons

- Interview with a Librarian
- Summary of a Community short paper and presentation
