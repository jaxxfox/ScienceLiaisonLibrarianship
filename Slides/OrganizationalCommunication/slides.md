# Organization Communication (Bullis, 2005)

- “People spend so much of their lives as members of organizations, whether they are involved in organizations where they work, volunteer, engage in political activity, or participate in religion. When people are not engaged in member involvement, they also function as clients, victims, customers, and so on.”
- “Organizations were, for the most part, assumed to be goal-directed entities. Productivity, consistent with national difficultiesduring the seventies in productivity growth, was often seen as theultimate outcome of concern. Our challenge was to link organiza-tional communication practices to productivity.”
- “Our challenge is to understand how communication as human process and as a field of inquiry is embedded in and dependent upon this interconnected world in which the material, biological, technological, political, economic, and so on are tightly connected.”

# My Generation

- As baby boomer leaders retire, Gen X and millennium leaders will need to replace them. 
- Generational identities can influence organizational outcomes related to socialization, turnover and conflict, as well as innovation and change.
- The three generations now in the library workplace will have unique expectations of leadership, as well as distinct views about important aspects of work.
- For example, generational groups are likely to think differently about the issue of job security. Because baby boomers value loyalty, they are prone to envision a longer timeline when they join an organization. Millennials and Gen Xers don’t have the same expectation of long term commitment from employers, but they expect more with regard to career development and advancement.

# Strategies suggested by the authors

- Plan for generational turnover.
- Institute incentive programs to encourage baby boomers to retire early and thus create opportunities for Gen Xers and millennials.
- Create leadership opportunities through reorganization.
- Hire non-MLS personnel for librarian positions.
- Reduce professional positions.
- Foster an organizational culture of learning.
- Reward performance and output rather than time in the office.

# Libraries’ Tweets during this pandemic

- Oldenburg (1989) created the third place in society idea and although libraries do a bunch of digital stuff, they are inexorably linked to their physical space, which remains the axis around which many services and activities revolve.
- The move to digital had several common topics:
  * mechanisms of library closure applied around the world;
  * health and safety at work;
  * how to offer library services remotely; and 
  * the gradual reopening of centers.

# The Study

- Tweets and retweets produced by 56 university libraries in Spain were studied to learn how libraries disseminated their activities, but also their position or interest in disseminating content particularly related to the coronavirus crisis.
- Dissemination of collections and online resources (e.g., topic guides, blogs, tutorials, etc.)
- Maintenance of university activity (e.g., messages related to the work of the library in online teaching, the dissemination of training courses and webinars, and other activities, many of which had to eliminate face-to-face interactions and adapt to an online format.
- Contextual information (a ton of stuff about monitoring the pandemic, community building, recommendations dealing with isolation, and support for healthcare workers). [#yomequedoencasa (#Istayhome), #estevirusloparamosunidos (#Wewillstopthisvirus-together), etc.]. 
- Dissemination of cultural and educational activities (external to the university environment). 
- Reliable scientific information on the coronavirus (scientific articles, reports, etc.)
- Misinformation. This category includes tweets and retweets related to the dissemination of fake news and hoaxes, as well as mechanisms for their prevention and which contest false information that has been published or widely disseminated.

# Results (10,994)

- The first type aimed to communicate changes in activities or services and how they have adapted. Practically all essential library activities, such as borrowing, extended return dates, VPN installation and database access, maintenance of interlibrary loans exclusively for digital works, …explanatory videos.
- The quarantine led to the development of campaigns to promote engagement with users, despite the requirement for physical separation. 
- Focusing on the needs of students and to support teaching. The suspension of face-to-face teaching has led to greater use of these digital collections.
- Dissemination of resources that are made available openly or under special conditions by publishers and providers.
- Encouragement, tips, reliable information

# Message Box (COMPASS)

- Effective science communication requires recognizing the differences between how scientists have traditionally been taught to communicate and how the rest of the world communicates.
- The Message Box consists of five sections to help you sort and distill your knowledge in a way that resonates with your audience. 
- It's based on the scientific underpinnings of how to communicate effectively.
- Who’s Your Audience?

# Why? And So what?

- Many scientists believe that if they simply share what they know with non-scienitsts, they’ll convince them to change their views, including on issues such as climate change, vaccination, or other topics. 
- But research in the field of science communication demonstrates that simply sharing more scientific information doesn’t change minds, attitudes, or behaviors. Instead, people interpret information through the lens of their own values and cultural identities, and will reject information that they feel is threatening to those values
- Avoid jargon!
