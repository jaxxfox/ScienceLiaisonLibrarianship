# Northwest Tree Octopus

- Tree octopus species, including the endangered Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus, are some of the most elusive creatures known to Man. Not many researchers have managed to photograph them in the wild and those few in captivity tend to hide in inaccessible corners of their cages.

# Infomawhatamacy?

- Typically people think literacy = reading
- Literacy can be thought of as competence in an area, the ability to apply knowledge and skills
- Library and Information science deals with
  * ‘Traditional’ literacy
  * Information literacy
  * Technology literacy
  * Media literacy
  * Visual literacy
  * Data literacy
- EVERYONE should be judicious, independent seekers, consumers, and creators of information: this is part of life now as we are exposed to information all the time

# Fundamentally ….

- Information literacy gives “a distinct advantage to its possessor” because literacy in the tools to acquire information and “knowledge for ascertaining and using information determines not only intellectual but social status.”

- Edward K. Owusu-Ansah,”Information Literacy and the Academic Library,” *The Journal of Academic Librarianship* 29, no. 4 (July 2003): 219-230.

#  Dunning‐Kruger Effect

- Basically, this effect means you are more confident when you know nothing than when you know something. 
- When you know something, you know what you don’t know and that there is much more you don’t know.
- This offers one potential explanation for why students who are not information literate report a high level of confidence in their ability to seek, evaluate, and use information. 
- According to research performed in the domain of psychology, people who are incompetent, particularly in areas in which people commonly have some orientation, tend to believe that their skills are above average and to overestimate their performance on a skills test.

  * Internet
  * Ask someone
  * Newspaper
  * Peer-reviewed research
- Choosing effective sources: evaluate the significance of your query
- Finding credible, reliable information
- Developing multiple appropriate strategies
