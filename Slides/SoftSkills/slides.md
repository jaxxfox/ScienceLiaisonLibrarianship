# Soft skills matter!

- AI is used to screen candidates. 
- The questions, and your answers to them, are designed to evaluate several aspects of a jobseeker's personality and intelligence, such as your risk tolerance and how quickly you respond to situations.
- Or as Pymetrics puts it, "to fairly and accurately measure cognitive and emotional attributes in only 25 minutes".
- Its AI software is now used in the initial recruitment processes of a number of multinational companies, such as McDonald's, bank JP Morgan, accountancy firm PWC, and food group Kraft Heinz. An interview with a human recruiter then follows if you pass.
- "It's about helping firms process a much wider pool [of applicants], and getting signals that someone will be successful in a job," says Pymetrics founder Frida Polli.

# Soft skills more important than ever?

- “Increased globalization, greater job insecurity, massification of higher education and the shift to a knowledge economy” means you need more than just a degree to separate your application in a more competitive environment.
- Employers value soft skills more than academic qualifications!
- These skills are transferable, 21st Century, key competencies to a successful life and well-functioning society.

“When you see a woman in silks and sables and diamonds speak to a little errand girl or a footman or a scullery maid as though they were the dirt under her feet, you may be sure of one thing; she hasn't come a very long way from the ground herself.”
― Emily Post, Etiquette

- Communication skills, Being Committee to work and Teamwork skills were ranked most important.
- Qualitative comments indicated students lacked self-awareness, in particular the ability to identify strengths and weaknesses.
- What can UT, CCI, SIS, do to address this perceived/actual lack of soft skills?

# Competency and expectations

- “a demonstrated ability to apply knowledge, skills, and attitudes to achieving observable results”
- “most development of their competencies had occurred ‘on-the-job’” 
- “Interviews agreed that, when seeking a new employee, communication skills are more important than technical knowhow”
- “combining soft skills with broad rather than deep technological competencies”

3. An appropriate level of computational sense, less in specific skills/knowledge and more in fluency with systems and an appreciation of technological possibilities

# Are soft skills racist?

- “Three factors underlie negative evaluations for Black men as workers: Racial stereotypes, cultural differences between employers and young Black men, and actual skill differences” (Moss & Tilly, 1996)
- What cultural differences exist across organizations, sectors, communities, countries, and so forth?

MOSS P, TILLY C. “Soft” Skills and Race: An Investigation of Black Men’s Employment Problems. *Work and Occupations.* 1996;23(3):252-276. doi:10.1177/0730888496023003002
