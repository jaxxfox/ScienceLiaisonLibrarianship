# Qualitative researchers are professional strangers

- **Communicating** – by asking questions, expressing understandings, forming relationships, and so on.
- *in vivo* –in the living of them.
- Participant Observer
- Taking notes, understanding actors

# What is ethnography?

- Ethnography is the study of social interactions, behaviors, and perceptions that occur within groups, teams, organizations, and communities. Its roots can be traced back to anthropological studies of small, rural (and often remote) societies that were undertaken in the early 1900s. 
- Informal or conversational interviews, which allow them to discuss, probe emerging issues, or ask questions about unusual events in a naturalistic manner.
- Data are examined to identify and to categorize themes and key issues that "emerge" from the data.
- Ethnographic research offers several advantages as participant observation enables ethnographers to "immerse" themselves in a setting, thereby generating a rich understanding of social action and its subtleties in different contexts.

# Ethnography in library literature

- Typically an embedded researcher combines direct observation of the  environment with interviews of key individuals to develop a culture-based under-standing of the group under study!
- In libraries, it is usual one of the librarians, so motives may influence data collection, questions asked, and the results!
- A compressed ethnography works most effectively when the researcher has an established relationship with the study environment and population on which to rely for cultural cues.
- *Ethnographish* observations term used in one of the readings because of the shorter-term, narrow context, easily replicable library research compared to more immersive anthropologist work.

# *Other* Matters

- Self: identify and differentiate
  * race/ethnicity, gender, social class/socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, (dis)abilities, and religion/religious beliefs
- Group (in-group; out-group): own terms, customs
- Community: apart or part

# One evaluation approach: Value Proposition

  * Validating your statements with the customer segment

---

# Value proposition steps

- Stage One: Choosing a Customer Segment (e.g., market)
  * Early-career Faculty 
  * Senior (retiring) Faculty 
  * Faculty with Teaching Focus 
  * Faculty with Research Focus 
  * Faculty within a specific discipline or department
- Stage Two: Understanding Your Customer
  * Jobs and Tasks (what must happen?)
  * Pains and Obstacles (what makes things hard?)
  * Gains and Desired Outcomes (what do you want?)

---

# Value proposition steps (cont’d)

- Stage Three: Describing Products and Services
  * Research (for and with) 
  * Documenting impact (for tenure and promotion) 
  * Institutional repository 
  * Course/curriculum design help
  * Can the Library’s products or services produce savings (time, money, effort)? 
  * How to?
- Stage Four: Articulating Benefits
  * Our [choose a product or services] help(s) [name your customer segment] who want to [itemize the task they want to do] by _____________ and _____________.
- Stage Five: Validating Value Propositions
