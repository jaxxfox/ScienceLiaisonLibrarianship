### Summary of a Community 
*25%*

[10 points for each item listed]

1. Introduce the community you chose. This might be a domain, discipline, organization, profession, or other group.
2. Provide an annotated list of the group’s prominent communication outlets (i.e., journals), organizations, associations, conferences, trainings, vendors, related industries.
3. Describe the common and frequent information needs of scientists in this community.
4. Design an evaluation for how you could study this community further.
5. Prepare a summary presentation to inform other liaisons (5 min).
6. To give full attention to this assignment, please produce at least 1,000 words of content.

### Interview with a Librarian 
*20%*
[5 points for each item listed]

- Locate and contact a willing librarian/information professional. For example, someone with a job you would like to have or know more about. This is a hectic time, but I’ve found that most librarians are very willing to help students (and like talking about themselves). This should take 20 minutes of their time.
- **Collect the librarians academic and work history.**
-  What is your current job title?
-  What is your current rank?
-  How many years in total have you been working in your current job?
-  How many years in total have you been working with research data (including relevant higher education and experience as a researcher)?
-  Please indicate your credentials and degrees.
-  Please provide any other education or training you have received that is applicable to performing your job.
- Your paper is your own, so you may use other questions that interest you. You should probably ask about typical liaison tasks from the readings, but all of this depends on the type of information professional you select.
- Write up all that you find in a paper.
- Please provide a conclusion that highlights what surprised you and what you would like to learn most in the class to prepare you for a job.
- To give full attention to the paper, please produce at least 1,000 words of content.



### Final Project
*35%*

Do not ask me what I want your research project to be about. This is an opportunity for you to select a topic that interests you!  A one-page proposal of your paper is due at 11:59PM on Mar. 10th. This proposal is worth 12 points.  The proposal should be written in sentence form (not an outline) and should contain the following:

- Select and describe a topic, with a working title, brief description of the topic you plan to research and also a literature review for consideration (at least 3 sources). Pick a topic that will benefit your future and that you will enjoy.

The remaining points for the assignment results from these items outline in the rubric below.

1. Find research articles (peer-reviewed) on the topic, and use your interpretation and evaluation of the research to inform important aspects of the liaison librarianship; DO NOT simply summarize what has been researched, but relate the research articles to each other and synthesize a theme out of the articles you find. Each topic will have a different number of key articles, but for a final paper this length I expect~15-20 citations.
2. Discuss future implications for the field related to your topic and specifically for your career.
3. Finally, you will prepare a 10-minute presentation of your paper to inform the class.
4. As a semester long assignment, I have high expectations for the quality of this work. You should produce a project that is of publishable quality. I am indifferent about structure or citation style; however, be consistent and do not hesitate to ask for clarification. In fact, this opportunity of the CALL research summit means all have a venue to share what you learn in an actual presentation, paper, or poster.
